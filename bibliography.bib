	            recognize abnormalities in the appearance of surface dangling
	            bonds. Of the machine learning methods tested, a convolutional

	            positive identification of degraded tips in 97\% of the test
	            cases. By using multiple points of comparison and majority voting

	abstract = {Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), a technique that records
	            the change in the tunneling current as a function of the bias
	            (dI/dV) across the gap between a tip and the sample, is a
	            powerful tool to characterize the electronic structure of single
	            molecules and nanomaterials. While performing STS, the structure
	            and condition of the scanning probe microscopy (SPM) tips are
	            critical for reliably obtaining high quality point spectra. Here,
	            we present an automated program based on machine learning models
	            that can identify the Au(111) Shockley surface state in dI/dV
	            point spectra and perform tip conditioning on clean or sparsely
	            covered gold surfaces with minimal user intervention. We employed
	            a straightforward height-based segmentation algorithm to analyze
	            STM topographic images to identify tip conditioning positions and
	            used 1789 archived dI/dV spectra to train machine learning models
	            that can ascertain the condition of the tip by evaluating the
	            quality of the spectroscopic data. Decision tree based ensemble
	            and boosting models and deep neural networks (DNNs) have been
	            shown to reliably identify tips in suitable conditions for STS.
	            We expect the automated program to reduce operational costs and
	            time, increase reproducibility in surface science studies, and
	            accelerate the discovery and characterization of novel
	            nanomaterials by STM. The strategies presented in this paper can
	            readily be adapted to STM tip conditioning on a wide variety of

	abstract = {The manual identification and in situ correction of the state of
	            the scanning probe tip is one of the most time-consuming and
	            tedious processes in atomic-resolution scanning probe microscopy.
	            This is due to the random nature of the probe tip on the atomic
	            level, and the requirement for a human operator to compare the
	            probe quality via manual inspection of the topographical images
	            after any change in the probe. Previous attempts to automate the
	            classification of the scanning probe state have focused on the
	            use of machine learning techniques, but the training of these
	            models relies on large, labeled data sets for each surface being
	            studied. These data sets are extremely time-consuming to create
	            and are not always available, especially when considering a new
	            substrate or adsorbate system. In this paper, we show that the
	            problem of tip classification from a topographical image can be
	            solved by using only a single image of the surface along with a
	            small amount of prior knowledge of the appearance of the system
	            in question with a method utilizing template matching (TM). We
	            find that by using these TM methods, comparable accuracy and
	            precision can be achieved to values obtained with the use of
	            machine learning. We demonstrate the efficacy of this technique
	            by training a machine learning-based classifier and comparing the
	            classifications with the TM classifier for two prototypical
	            silicon-based surfaces. We also apply the TM classifier to a
	            number of other systems where supervised machine learning-based
	            training was not possible due to the nature of the training data
	            sets. Finally, the applicability of the TM method to surfaces
	            used in the literature, which have been classified using machine
	            learning-based methods, is considered.},
